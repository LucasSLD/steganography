bitEstimator.py : I don't know what this bit estimator is for and to what part of the paper it is related to... -> according to chatGPT it is used to estimate the number of bits required to represent the compressed features.
		  Why do you need a probabilistic approach to estimate the number of bits needed to represent features ? Knowing the number of bits used to represent compressed features gives an idea of the efficiency of the
		  compression.
