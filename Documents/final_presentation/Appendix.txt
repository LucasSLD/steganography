III - Steganography
    III.1 Naive method: LSB replacement
        III.1.1 The idea
        III.1.2 Implementation (and visual impact on the image)
    III.2 Side information: quantization error
        III.2.1 The idea
        III.2.2 Implementation (and visual impact on the image)
        III.2.3 Modifying the cost
IV  - Steganalysis
